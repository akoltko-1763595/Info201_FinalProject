          are much more liberal with their appreciation, and lean toward liking newer music more."),

For each of those artists, we also found their popularity on Spotify."),

                 ranking, we find that as sales increases the ranking generally improves. The correlation coefficient is not very high,
                 but it can still suggest a relationship. To supplement the conclusion from Q1,
                 Rolling Stone may like older albums, but they are not deterred by commercial success."),

                 the same over time, the average greatness of music lessens according to Rolling Stone. The correlation
                 coefficient of this is stronger than with sales and greatness, which aligns with our first question's

Top-500 Music

Created by Andrew Koltko, Alexander Honeycutt, Spenser Hall, and Samantha Steele

This application explores ratings and sales of well-known songs that are commonly called "great" by critics and fans alike. The visualizations explore how rankings relate to sales, where rankings come from, and their overall validity. Our primary sources were Rolling Stones's Top-500 lists and the Spotify API.
